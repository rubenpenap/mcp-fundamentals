# Linked Resources

👨‍💼 You've already made your resources discoverable and accessible—now let's make
them even more useful! In this step, you'll learn how to link a resource
directly in your tool responses.

Why does this matter? Sometimes, an embedded resource is more content than is
necessary for a tool's output. It could be a whole video potentially. By linking
to resource references, you enable clients (and LLMs) to decide whether they
want to follow links to additional context, download files, subscribe to updates,
or fetch related data on demand.

Your goal in this step:

- Update the `list_entries` and `list_tags` tools so when they create a tag or
  entry, we tell them it was created and also include a reference to the tag or
  entry (using the `type: 'resource_link'` content type in the response).
- Make sure the resource includes the correct URI and metadata, so clients can
  easily fetch the resource if they want more details.

This pattern unlocks powerful workflows—tools and resources working together to
provide richer, more actionable results.

Here's an example of the content type if we were to link to a taco ingredient
resource:

```json
{
	"type": "resource_link",
	"uri": "taco://ingredients/1",
	"name": "Lettuce",
	"description": "A delicious lettuce ingredient",
	"mimeType": "application/json"
}
```

To test this out, check the response from `list_entries` and `list_tags` and
notice the resource is included in the response.
