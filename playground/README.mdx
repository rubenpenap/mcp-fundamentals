👨‍💼 Let's make it easier for users to get helpful suggestions in your journaling
app—without having to write their own prompts from scratch every time.

In this step, you'll add support for MCP's prompt capability to your server.
This will allow clients to discover and invoke reusable, parameterized
prompts—starting with a prompt that helps users get tag suggestions for a
specific journal entry.

By exposing prompts, you'll enable richer, more guided interactions for your
users, making common workflows (like tagging entries) just a click away.
