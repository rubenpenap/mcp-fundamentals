  <strong>
    Meet users in the AI apps they already use
  </strong>
  <p>
    Your users are increasingly getting accustomed to using natural language to communicate with AI apps like ChatGPT, Claude Desktop, and Cursor. With MCP,
    you can build AI-powered apps that integrate with these apps, allowing you
    to meet users where they are.

## Prerequisites

- JavaScript/TypeScript experience
- Node.js experience

## Pre-workshop Resources

Here are some resources you can read before taking the workshop to get you up to
speed on some of the tools and concepts we'll be covering:

- [Letting AI Interface with Your App with MCPs](https://www.epicai.pro/letting-ai-interface-with-your-app-with-mcps-talk)
- [MCP Introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
- [Your AI Assistant Instructor: The EpicShop MCP Server](https://www.epicai.pro/your-ai-assistant-instructor-the-epicshop-mcp-server-0eazr)
- [How to Debug Your MCP Server](https://www.epicai.pro/how-to-debug-your-mcp-server-38qyl)
- [MCP Tool Design: From APIs to AI-First Interfaces](https://useai.substack.com/p/mcp-tool-design-from-apis-to-ai-first)

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2.18 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v22.13.0 or greater
- [npm][npm] v8.16.0 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

This is a pretty large project (it's actually many apps in one) so it can take
several minutes to get everything set up the first time. Please have a strong
network connection before running the setup and grab a snack.

> **Warning**: This repo is _very_ large. Make sure you have a good internet
> connection before you start the setup process. The instructions below use
> `--depth` to limit the amount you download, but if you have a slow connection,
> or you pay for bandwidth, you may want to find a place with a better
> connection.

Follow these steps to get this set up:

```sh nonumber
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/epicweb-dev/mcp-fundamentals.git
cd mcp-fundamentals
npm run setup
```

To make sure your environment is running correctly, please follow these
additional steps:

1. Run the workshop app with `npm start`
2. Open the last exercise solution at
   [`/exercise/05/02/solution?preview=solution`](http://localhost:5639/exercise/05/02/solution?preview=solution)
3. Click the "Start App" button
4. Click the "Connect" button

You'll know it's working if you see a green dot and the word "Connected" in the
MCP Inspector app.

If you experience errors during this setup process, please open [an
issue][issue] with as many details as you can offer.

## The Workshop App
