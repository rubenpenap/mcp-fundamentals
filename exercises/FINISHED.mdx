# MCP Fundamentals 🧱

Hooray! You're all done! 👏👏

## What you've learned

### 1. MCP Basics & Ping

- **Core Concepts:** You learned the foundational structure of the Model Context
  Protocol (MCP), which enables standardized communication between clients and
  servers.
- **Ping Tool:** Implemented a simple `ping` tool to verify server connectivity
  using JSON-RPC, establishing the groundwork for MCP-compliant servers.

### 2. Tools

- **Tool Registration:** Explored how to define and register server-side
  functions (tools) that clients can invoke.
- **Input Validation:** Used JSON Schema (and Zod) to validate tool arguments.
- **Dynamic Responses:** Built tools that return both static and dynamic
  results, and learned about trust, safety, and human-in-the-loop design.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented robust error handling to provide clear,
  MCP-compliant feedback to clients.

### 3. Resources

- **Resource Concept:** Learned how to expose structured data (files, database
  records, etc.) as resources via MCP.
- **Resource URIs:** Used unique URIs and metadata to identify and describe
  resources.
- **Resource Operations:** Enabled clients to list, read, and (optionally)
  subscribe to resources, supporting both static and dynamic data.

### 4. Prompts

- **Reusable Prompts:** Introduced MCP's prompt system for exposing reusable,
  parameterized instructions to clients and LLMs.
- **Prompt Registration:** Registered prompts that guide model behavior, making
  workflows more accessible and consistent for users.

---

**In summary:**

You've built a robust MCP server that supports tools, resources, prompts, and
sampling. You've learned to design for extensibility, safety, and real-world use
cases—empowering both users and language models to interact with your server in
powerful, structured ways.
