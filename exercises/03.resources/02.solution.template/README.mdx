# Resource Templates

👨‍💼 Fantastic work! You've just leveled up your MCP server by implementing
dynamic resource templates with a list callback. Now your server can expose
entire collections of resources—like entries and tags—making them discoverable
and accessible to clients and LLMs alike.

This is a huge step toward building rich, interactive, and context-aware
applications. By leveraging resource templates and the list callback, you've
made it possible for clients to browse, search, and retrieve structured data on
demand.

Key takeaways from this step:

- How to define parameterized resource templates
- How to implement a list callback to dynamically enumerate resources from your
  database
- How to make individual resources accessible by unique URIs

You're well on your way to building a truly powerful and flexible MCP server.
Keep going—there's even more you can do with resources!
