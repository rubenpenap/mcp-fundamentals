# Embedded Resources

👨‍💼 Right now we have a `get_entry` tool that returns a journal entry. So LLMs
can decide to get the entry details if it's relevant to the task. We also have
a resource for getting entries by IDs as well.

The MCP spec has a `resource` content type that allows you to embed resources
in tool responses. So instead of just returning the entry details, we can
include the entry resource in the response so the MCP client can subscribe to it
or request it again in the future.

Here's an example of the content type if we were to embed a taco resource:

```json
{
	"type": "resource",
	"resource": {
		"uri": "taco://ingredients/1",
		"mimeType": "application/json",
		"text": "{\"name\": \"Lettuce\", \"description\": \"A delicious lettuce ingredient\"}"
	}
}
```

Let's update the `get_entry` tool to embed the entry resource in the response.
Test this out by using the `get_entry` tool and make sure it shows the resource
info in the response.
