# Resources

👨‍💼 Our users really want to include their tags in the context as they write
their journal entries. They could just ask the LLM to run the `list_tags` tool,
but that's not as efficient. In fact, the host application they're using could
proactively request the resources we expose without any input from the user as
well. Making it both efficient and convenient for the user.

In this step, you'll take your first step toward exposing structured data from
your server—not just as tool responses, but as first-class resources that
clients can discover and read.

Your goal:

- Declare the `resources` capability on your server.
- Register a simple resource called "tags" that provides information about all
  the tags in the database. This resource should be available at the URI
  `epicme://tags` and return a JSON array of tags.

This is your first taste of the MCP resources system. No need for dynamic
templates or database integration yet—just get a static resource registered and
returning a simple value.

Here's an example of a resource:

```ts
agent.server.registerResource(
	'hello',
	'hello://world',
	{
		title: 'Hello',
		description: 'A simple hello world resource',
	},
	async (uri) => {
		return {
			contents: [
				{
					mimeType: 'text/plain',
					text: 'Hello, world!',
					uri: uri.toString(),
				},
			],
		}
	},
)
```
