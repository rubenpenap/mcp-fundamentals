# Tools

👨‍💼 Great job! You've now built a server that can expose tools to clients, handle
arguments, and return dynamic results. This is a huge leap toward building
interactive, AI-powered systems that can do real work for users.

With these skills, you can create all sorts of tools—calculators, data fetchers,
workflow automators, and more. The possibilities are wide open!

Keep going—there's a lot more to explore and build! We're going to take tools a
little further.
